# C# Windows Form Applications
This repo doesn't contain just a single project. There are some different, small samples. Will be developed in time!

# What Is Your Colour

A user login form was created in the first form. If you enter the username and password correctly, the second form screen will appear in front of you. (username: admin password: 123) In the second form, you are asked to choose your name, and a color for your day. Special surprise messages are displayed for you according to the color you choose.
