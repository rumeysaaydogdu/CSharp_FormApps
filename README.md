# What Is Your Colour

A user login form was created in the first form. If you login the username and password correctly, the second form screen will appear in front of you. (username: admin password: 123) If you login incorrectly, you will receive a message telling you which of your username or password is incorrect. In the second form, you are asked to choose your name, and a color for your day. Special surprise messages are displayed for you according to the color you choose.
